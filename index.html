                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>A mobile application that helps its users find reliable automobile maintenance services with
                        ease.</p>
                    <p>It is unavoidable that a vehicle will require maintenance at some point, but the steps involved
                        in doing so can be inconvenient. Problems include not knowing any mechanics in the region, or
                        worse, entrusting it to an unskilled one.</p>
                    <p>This application aims to make car maintenance and repair a seamless process for its users.</p>

                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>The challenges that sparked this idea were dealing with the long time it takes an automobile
                        mechanic to fix a car and the impact it has on owners' daily routine, as well as mechanics'
                        substandard work.</p>
                    <p>I saw this as a chance to develop a solution that provides users with access to dependable
                        mechanics wherever they are and help them to deal with alternative means of getting around while
                        receiving automobile maintenance.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>The goals of this study are to find a way to make it easy and quick for users to gain access to
                        reliable mechanics, and to give them an option for alternative means of transportation.</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <section>
                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            <p>During the interview process, participants expressed their dissatisfaction with the
                                following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Automobile mechanics took longer than planned to finish repairs on their
                                    automobiles, causing them to change their plans because they were so reliant on
                                    their vehicles.</li>
                                <li>In cases where cars have problems on an unfamiliar road, users complained about not
                                    having a way to get reliable mechanics in the area.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I then used competitive research to look at alternative ways this problem has been
                                managed in the past, and it was discovered that these service providers were only
                                available in select places, which meant that reaching some clients would either take
                                longer or not happen at all.</p>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h3>Personas</h3>
                            <p>Based on the insights from interviews and research, I set out to build a solution for
                                specific target groups:</p>

                            <img src="./assets/Wura Aboyeji.png" alt="Personal 2">

                        <section>
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>I created some product requirements that would meet the needs of the users based on the
                                use cases of these personas.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A feature that would provide users with a list of automotive specialists in a
                                    certain location, such as mechanics and tow services, based on the sort of service
                                    needed.</li>
                                <li>A feature to allow users to book and monitor services selected.</li>
                                <li>A feature that allows the user to choose to borrow a car from the mechanic while
                                    theirs is being repaired.</li>
                                <li>A feature that reminds users to schedule a service for a certain date.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>To make these features possible, we'd need mechanics that specialize in specific services
                                in their various locations. This means we'd have to create two applications: one for
                                those who want to offer their services to register and accept services, and another for
                                others who want to find them. However, for the sake of this case study, we will only
                                look into the latter.</p>

                            <p>With the requirements in mind, it was important to develop an intuitive workflow to give
                                users a chance to achieve their goals seamlessly.</p>

                            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                            <p>After paper sketches and several iterations, I created a mid-fidelity wireframe that
                                shows the layout and structure of the application.</p>
                            <img src="./assets/Wireframes.png" alt="wireframes">
                            <p>Then I decided to incorporate navigation and functionality by doing a Low Fidelity
                                prototype which was then used for usability testing. <a

                            <p>As this is a new type of product, I incorporated onboarding screens to inform users about
                                the application's features and benefits, as well as a Log In and Sign Up link on each
                                screen.</p>

                            <p>After conducting usability testing, it showed that this application reduced the time it
                                took for users to get services from reliable mechanics.</p>

                            <p>This case study was challenging and exciting. I improved on my design process and I also
                                learned how to think like a designer.</p>
